# Automobile Configuration Web Application

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to explore, search, and configure automobiles. The application will provide an intuitive interface for users to browse through a catalog of vehicles, apply filters based on their preferences, and view detailed configurations. The platform will be designed to meet the client's requirements for a modern, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

### Key Features:
1. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific automobile models or brands.
2. **Filtering Options**: Users can filter automobiles based on criteria such as price range, fuel type, transmission, and more.
3. **Configuration Details**: Users can view detailed configurations for each automobile, including specifications, features, and customization options.

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend:
- **Framework**: Bootstrap (for responsive and modern UI design).
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Additional Tools**: jQuery for dynamic interactions (if needed).

### Backend:
- **Framework**: Python Flask (for lightweight and efficient server-side logic).
- **Database**: MongoDB (for flexible and scalable data storage).
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs to handle communication between the frontend and backend.

### Hosting and Deployment:
- **Containerization**: Docker (to ensure consistent deployment across environments).
- **Hosting Platform**: To be determined if needed.

### Plugins and Libraries:
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap plugins for UI components (e.g., modals, carousels).
- **Backend**: Flask extensions such as Flask-SQLAlchemy (for MongoDB integration) and Flask-WTF (for form handling).

## Client Requirements
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The application must be easy to navigate, with a clean and modern design.
2. **Responsive Design**: The application should work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
3. **Scalability**: The backend and database should be designed to handle future growth in data and user traffic.
4. **Performance**: Fast loading times and efficient search/filter functionality are critical.
5. **Security**: Secure user data and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
